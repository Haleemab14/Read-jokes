# 😂 Random Joke Generator

A fun and simple JavaScript project that shows a random joke each time you click a button.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

* A button with class `.btn` is used to trigger the jokes.
* When clicked, it displays a random joke from a predefined **array of jokes**.
* The joke appears on the screen inside a dynamically created `<h3>` element.
* Each new click shows a different random joke.

---

## ⚡ Features

* Random joke generation.
* 20 funny jokes included by default.
* Jokes displayed dynamically without reloading the page.
* Simple and lightweight (pure HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Create an `index.html` file with a button element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Random Joke Generator</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button class="btn">Tell me a joke 😂</button>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Save your JavaScript code in a file called `script.js`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
4. Click the button → Enjoy random jokes!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **JavaScript** for logic.
* **HTML** for structure.
* **Bootstrap (optional)** for styling.

Do you want me to also write the **HTML + CSS template** (a styled button + centered joke display) so you can just plug in your JS and run it nicely?
